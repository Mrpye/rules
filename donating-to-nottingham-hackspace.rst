Donating to Preston Hackspace
================================

**Consider the benefit to Preston Hackspace** when making a donation. Do this by posting your items and offers to the Google Group. Is there a general consensus from the members about its use or usefulness?

Remember that the Hackspace has **limited storage space**. Donâ€™t bring in things without asking or checking.

Items donated that currently have a storage location (such as kettle leads, LEDs, plugs and pens) should be **placed directly into their allocated space**. Donations to be broken down or repatriated should be left on the **wooden storage rack** at the back of the Hackspace.

Donations left on the wooden rack for **four weeks** will be scrapped and removed from the Hackspace completely.

If a non-member with a donation arrives whilst you are in the space, **please don't accept it** - point them to the Google Group.
