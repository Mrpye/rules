Storage in the Hackspace
========================

Remember that the **Hackspace has limited storage space**. We have designated storage space for **consumables, resources** and **members’ storage**.

Members are entitled to a **35l storage box**. You can buy a box from any of the Membership Team or Trustees for £5. You must label your box with your name. A contact method (such as email) is also appreciated on the label, to help identify the owner of a box.

If you are working on a project that is too large for a 35l box you can store it on the Large Project Shelves. It can be stored there whilst it is actively being worked on, and must always be labelled according to our **Do Not Hack** rules.

If your project is too big for the Large Project Shelves, a storage request must be made on the Google Group.

If you wish to **store solvents** or other flammable/dangerous liquids, they must be stored in the members' section of the solvents cupboard. Please bear Rule 0 in mind when doing this, and pay attention to the stated storage limit of the cupboard - if your liquid will not fit, take it home

If you use the **spray booth**, you can of course leave your project to dry for up to 24 hours and drying racks are provided for this outside the booth, however please ensure it is labelled with a Do Not Hack sign - this can be on the shelves if applying a label would damage your project.
